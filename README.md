# TesseractPi Red
#### Just a Firefox theme I made while I was bored

My favorite color is red and I like dark mode. Because I couldn't find any good dark red themes on the Firefox add-on store, I decided to make my own. You can install it at [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tesseractpi-red](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tesseractpi-red).
